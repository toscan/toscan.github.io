       	      <h2> Mike </h2>
            <p>Girl you know we belong together <br>
I have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this <br>
You'll be mine forever baby<br>
You just see</p>
              <h2> Nate </h2>
            <p>We belong together<br>
And you know that I am right<br>
Why do you play with my heart?<br>
Why do you play with my mind?<br>
Said we'd be forever<br>
Said it'd never die<br>
How could you love me and leave me and never
say goodbye ?</p>
            <h2> Wanya </h2>
            <p> When I can't sleep at night
without holding you tight<br>
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry<br>
Pain in my head<br>
Oh, I'd rather be dead<br>
Spinning around and around</p>
             <h2> Chorus </h2>
            <p>Although we've come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can't let go<br>
It's unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can't let go<br>
It's unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you</p>
            <h2> Shawn </h2>
            <p>Girl, I know you really love me<br>
You just don't realize<br>
You've never been there before<br>
It's only<br>
Your first time<br>
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try<br>
We should be happy together forever<br>
You and I</p>
             <h2>Wanya</h2>
            <p>Will you love me again
Like you loved me before<br>
This time I want you to love me much more<br>
This time instead<br>
Just come to my bed<br>
And baby just don't let me go</p>
             <h2> Chorus </h2>
            <p>Although we've come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can't let go<br>
It's unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can't let go<br>
It's unnatural <br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you</p>
             <h2> Mike </h2>
            <p>Girl, I'm here for you<br>
All those times at night
When you just hurt me<br>
And just ran out with that other fella<br>
Baby I knew about it<br>
I just didn't care<br>
You just don't understand how much I love
Do you?<br>
I'm here for you<br>
I'm not about to go out on cheat you<br>
(Maybe I'll forgive you)<br>
Just like you did baby
But that's alright<br>
I love you anyway<br>
(Maybe you will try)<br>
And I'm still going to be here for you until my dying day baby <br>
(We should be happy together forever)<br>
Right now<br>
I'm just in so much pain baby<br>
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)<br>
Will you?<br>
Just come back to me</p>
            <p> (Lonely) <br>
            	Yes baby, my heart is lonely (Lonely)<br>
My heart hurts baby (Lonely)<br>
Yes, I feel pain too<br>
Baby please</p>
            <h2> Wanya </h2>
            <p> This time instead <br> Just come to my bed <br>
And baby just don't let me go</p>
            <h2> Chorus </h2>
            <p>Although we've come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can't let go<br>
It's unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Although we've come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can't let go<br>
It's unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
